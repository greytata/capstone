## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview  

This project investigates inconsistencies between **UWAâ€™s internal Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP)** student enrolment records and the **Australian Governmentâ€™s official funding allocations**.  
Using three official datasets â€”  
1. *Student Enrolment Data (2024)*  
2. *Indexed Government Funding Rates (PDF)*  
3. *Funding Agreement (2024)*  

The team built a **data warehouse**, conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and designed a **reconciliation prototype** to explain and visualise funding mismatches.  

Our findings reveal that the **root cause of discrepancies** lies in **different data granularity and reporting logic** between UWA and the Government:  
- UWAâ€™s internal data are recorded at the **unit / course** level,  
- Government allocations are calculated at the **Funding Cluster Ã— Field of Education (FOE)** level.
