## Project Overview  

This project investigates inconsistencies between **UWA’s internal Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP)** student enrolment records and the **Australian Government’s official funding allocations**.  
Using three official datasets —  
1. *Student Enrolment Data (2024)*  
2. *Indexed Government Funding Rates (PDF)*  
3. *Funding Agreement (2024)*  

The team built a **data warehouse**, conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and designed a **reconciliation prototype** to explain and visualise funding mismatches.  

Our findings reveal that the **root cause of discrepancies** lies in **different data granularity and reporting logic** between UWA and the Government:  
- UWA’s internal data are recorded at the **unit / course** level,  
- Government allocations are calculated at the **Funding Cluster × Field of Education (FOE)** level.

## Methodology  

### 1.ETL & Data Warehouse Design  

- Imported and standardised three data sources into PostgreSQL.  
- Built one **fact table (`fact_enrolment_2024`)** and multiple **dimension tables (`dim_foe`, `dim_cluster`, `dim_fees`)**.  
- Created relationships based on `FOE code` and `Funding Cluster`.  
- Designed the data model to support aggregation at *Funding Cluster × FOE* level.  

**Key SQL Logic Example:**  
```sql
SELECT
  ca.funding_cluster,
  se.unit_primary_foe_code AS foe_code,
  SUM(se.eftsl_2024) AS total_eftsl,
  SUM(regexp_replace(ca.commonwealth_contribution_2024, '[^0-9\.]', '', 'g')::numeric * se.eftsl_2024) AS total_gov_contr
FROM raw.student_enrolments_2024 se
JOIN raw.csp_allocation_2024 ca
  ON se.unit_primary_foe_code = ca.foe_code
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```

###  EDA & Insights  

**Objective:** Detect anomalies and patterns in CSP enrolments and government funding allocation.  

**Findings:**  
- **EFTSL Distribution:** Most students have EFTSL ≤ 1; outliers (EFTSL > 3) likely caused by unit-level duplication.  
- **Discipline Pattern:** Medicine and Health units dominate total funding (>30%), consistent with federal rates.  
- **Aggregate Check:** UWA total Commonwealth contribution ≈ **$161.9M** vs. Government official **$147.2M**,  
  explained by:  
  - Missing FOE mapping (366 records)  
  - No *grandfathered students* data  
  - Absence of student-level identifiers (possible aggregation bias)  

**Visualization (Tableau):**  
- Bar chart: Total funding by Funding Cluster  
- Pie chart: Proportion of government vs. student contributions  
- Highlight table: FOE vs. Δ (%) funding variance
