UWA CSP Funding Reconciliation Project

Project Overview
This project investigates inconsistencies between UWA’s internal Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) student enrolment records and the Australian Government’s official funding allocations.

Using three official datasets：

-Student Enrolment Data (2024)
-Indexed Government Funding Rates (PDF)
-Funding Agreement (2024)

The team built a data warehouse, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), and designed a reconciliation prototype to explain and visualise funding mismatches. Our findings reveal that the root cause of discrepancies lies in different data granularity and reporting logic between UWA and the Government:

-UWA’s internal data are recorded at the unit / course level,
-Government allocations are calculated at the Funding Cluster × Field of Education (FOE) level.
